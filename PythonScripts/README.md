# MiscPythonScripts

This is a collection of scripts I've made or am in the process of making. At first many may just be for testing or basic problem solving, eventually though they will typically be for things such as verifying backups, specific data transfers, filling out boring paperwork, or to speed up the most hated of all tasks, busywork.
